This is probably the best pizza I have ever had. They have great service and a friendly staff. The 3 star rating is for two reasons. First, I ordered a twelve inch pizza with pepperoni only and it was $26 dollars. Even though it’s great pizza I think that’s a little steep. Second, once we ordered our pizzas it took 40 minutes to get it. I came in to the restaurant already super hungry so that was definitely a turn off. It’s wasn’t that busy as well but hey, sometimes  things happen that the customer doesn’t know so I guess it happens. Still the best pizza that I’ve had. Thanks for reading.

This is best pizza I've had so far in New York City honestly. And for so cheap. The place isn't very fancy but the pizza beats everything. I always try their white pizza and margarita because I'm vegetarian but they also have some interesting meat ones. Its a place you must try at least once.

My favorite Swiss restaurant in New York. There is a secret back room with only a few tables and a bar. During the winter months the back room turns into a fondue room. Try to get a reservation there if you can. The fondue is really good, but I can also recommend the zucchini chips served with a killer feta dip. For breakfast, their Bircher muesli topped with berries and fresh fruit is amazing. Remember to bring enough cash (it’s cash only).

Popular matcha place with excellent options and a busy vibe. The service was good. I received a well constructed drink with a relatively short wait. My main criticism is choice of atmosphere, the music was too loud to have a quite conversation and I found it difficult to hear my orders readiness being announced. As good choice for a cup to go.

Tasty tapas. Attentive service staff. Did not have Crown Royal at the bar! We were in the downstairs bar for a corporate function. They pulled out all the stops highlighting our particular business segment. Recommend a return visit to check out their standard tapas offering.

Decent food, cool feel down an alley. But overpriced and over-hyped for what it is. The artichoke dip was unique and tasty. Thankfully, they brought out more bread chips.

The food is truly excellent. Our server, however, was not just inattentive but uniquely rude, which stinks because it overshadowed an experience we were really looking forward to at P&K. The service was poor enough, in fact, that I reached out to the owners, and have gotten only silence. Which means I'll never go back or get to recommend this place to friends who love this food as much as I do. There are *so* many other places in the area that offer good food *and* understand the basics of quality service. Keep your money & keep it moving!

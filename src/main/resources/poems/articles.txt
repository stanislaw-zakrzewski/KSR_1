to file a registration statement with the securities and
exchange commission for an offering of cumulative convertible
preferred partnership units in Permian Partners L.P.

Intergroup to continue to business of Permian Corp, acquired by
the company in 1985.
    The company said Permian will continue to manage the
business as a general partner, retaining a 35 pct stake in the
partnership in the form of common and general partnership
units.
    It did not say how many units would be offered or what the

BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
share.
    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
act alone."
    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
Chicago.
    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods
Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangements
in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.
    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD> we've been
after for years," Douglas told analysts.

Brown-Forman Inc said its board
has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase
in the company cash dividend.
    The company cited its improved earnings outlook and
continued strong cash flow as reasons for raising the dividend.
    Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B
common shares would be effective March 13.
    The company said directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable
April one to holders of record March 20. Prior to the split,
the company had paid 31 cts quarterly.
    Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third 
quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a
seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.
    Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0
mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08
dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of
37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.
    The company said lower corporate tax rates and the
restructuring "are expected to substantially improve
Brown-Forman's earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."

Venezuela and its bank advisory
committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
February, bankers said.
    They declined to disclose details because two or three
representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
of their senior management for the new terms.
    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and
could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
the bankers said.
    "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the
broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
rates are in place," one senior banker said.
    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier
terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
investment in Venezuela.
    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been
going on intermittently for several months, follows the
announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.
    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,
including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.
    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.

The Tower Commission report, which
says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms
deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
dominance in Washington, political analysts said.
    "This is certification of incompetence," private political
analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower
report made public today.
    "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board
and was denied credentials."
    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John
Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican
senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president
clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."
    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the
government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.
    "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican
political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we
won't do it again'?"
    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
the report was like "an anvil falling on us."
    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study
group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of
regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,
the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
    The report may also undermine the standing of Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George
Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
    "They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences," it said.
    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central
Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong
criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran
initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.
    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health
reasons last month.
    "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
being heroes," Tower told reporters.
    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.
    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
deal with Iran became public last November, his personal
popularity is still relatively high.
    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed
that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in
control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
doing a good job as president.
    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a
Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power
brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
    "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.
    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
address next week.
    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting
a dramatic turnaround.
    "The White House has to avoid building expectations that
cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
"They have to recognize there is no quick fix."
    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity
has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's
elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
of the Senate to the Democrats.

    But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been the

Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would."
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

inflation
plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
pct inflation rate.
    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank
economist said.
    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
foreign debt.
    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
under 150 mln.

A group of Republican governors and

conservation reserve program by up to 20 mln acres.
    Under current law, between 40 and 45 mln acres of erodible
land must be enrolled in the program by the end of fiscal 1990.
    The Republican Task Force on Farm and Rural America, headed
by Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (Kan.), said they would
consider drafting legislation to increase the reserve by
between 15 and 20 mln acres.
    Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) told Reuters he would offer
a bill to expand the reserve to 67 mln acres.

A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy
in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.
    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
investment.
    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
tax reform than we thought."
    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
office and computing equipment orders.
    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
economists said.
    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
0.9 pct.
    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
by more than tax reform.
    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
than the actual gains that took place in November and
December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
Montagu's Maude said.
    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
January's report, given that other reports have reflected
strength.
    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
December.
    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
have to ease to ensure global growth."

Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

AM International Inc, reporting an
operating loss for the January 31 second quarter, said
prospects for the balance of the fiscal year remain good.
    It said orders at its Harris Graphics subsidiary, acquired
in June 1986, "continue to run at a strong pace." For the six
months, orders rose 35 pct over the corresponding prior-year
period, or on an annualized basis are running at about 630 mln
dlrs.
    The backlog at Harris is up 30 pct from the beginning of
the fiscal year, AM said.
    AM International said its old division are expected to
benefit from recent new product introductions and the decline
in the value of the dollar.
    "Research, development and engineering expenditures in
fiscal 1987 will be in the 45-50 mln dlr range, and the company
said it has allocated another 30-40 mln dlrs for capital
expenditures.
    Earlier AM reported a fourth quarter operating loss of two
cts a share compared to profits of seven cts a share a year
ago. Revenues rose to 291.8 mln dlrs from 151.1 mln dlrs.

Argentina could suspend payments on
its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr
loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party
Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station.
    "Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the
negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth
of the country," he added.
    Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New
York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks,
told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the
banks were divided on the loan request.
    Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day
of talks had been postponed.
    He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of
Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest
payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was
to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in
1987, Baglini said.
    "Debtor nations should not have to take from their own
pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest
payments," he added.

The chairmen and senior Republican
members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed
legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to
an employee stock ownership plan.
    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion
dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.
    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions
after Sept 26, 1987.
    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen
Bob Packwood (R-Ore).
    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction
enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad
and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four
years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less
than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.
    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which
allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a
statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows
many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax
entirely when they die."
    He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates
to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of
promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not
meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as
is currently estimated."
    He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the
modification of the provision in accordance with its intended
purpose."

Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest
publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new
daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president
Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.
    The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec
government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;Donohue
Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper
mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.
    "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This
is not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that he
plans to announce a decision early next week.
    Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last
year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily
newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the
second-largest circulation paper in Canada.
    A new daily would give Montreal its second English-
language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city
the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North
America, analysts have said.
    Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English
language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six
months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new
venture would have the support of major advertisers.
    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55
pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of
two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project
but has not decided whether he would take partners in the
newspaper venture.
    He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one
of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.
    "It would be the possibility of doing something else in the
short term," Peladeau said.
    Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L>
does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.
    Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake
in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the
govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British
printing acquiring the other 49 pct.
    "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of
newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to
print the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said to
myself...next time we'll be ready."
    Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint
capacity however, is already committed to other buyers.
    Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year
and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror
newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.

Showers continued throughout the week in
the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
lowered the debt and preferred stock ratings of USX Corp and
its units. About seven billion dlrs of securities is affected.
    Moody's said Marathon Oil Co's recent establishment of up
to one billion dlrs in production payment facilities on its
prolific Yates Field has significant negative implications for
USX's unsecured creditors.
    The company appears to have positioned its steel segment
for a return to profit by late 1987, Moody's added.
    Ratings lowered include those on USX's senior debt to BA-1
from BAA-3.

Computer Terminal Systems Inc said
it has completed the sale of 200,000 shares of its common
stock, and warrants to acquire an additional one mln shares, to
&lt;Sedio N.V.> of Lugano, Switzerland for 50,000 dlrs.
    The company said the warrants are exercisable for five
years at a purchase price of .125 dlrs per share.
    Computer Terminal said Sedio also has the right to buy
additional shares and increase its total holdings up to 40 pct
of the Computer Terminal's outstanding common stock under
certain circumstances involving change of control at the
company.
    The company said if the conditions occur the warrants would
be exercisable at a price equal to 75 pct of its common stock's
market price at the time, not to exceed 1.50 dlrs per share.
    Computer Terminal also said it sold the technolgy rights to
its Dot Matrix impact technology, including any future
improvements, to &lt;Woodco Inc> of Houston, Tex. for 200,000
dlrs. But, it said it would continue to be the exclusive
worldwide licensee of the technology for Woodco.
    The company said the moves were part of its reorganization
plan and would help pay current operation costs and ensure
product delivery.
    Computer Terminal makes computer generated labels, forms,
tags and ticket printers and terminals.

Ohio Mattress Co said its first
quarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mln
dlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal
1986.
    The company said any decline would be due to expenses
related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current
quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of
the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.
    Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales
will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.
    Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in
late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early
April this year.
    It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,
including conducting appraisals, in connection with the
acquisitions.
